## AbleSet

This module allows you to control AbleSet from Companion.

If you run Companion on the same machine as AbleSet, you don't have to configure anything.

If AbleSet is running on a different machine, set the `Server Hosts/IPs` field to the IP address of the AbleSet machine.
You can provide multiple hosts separated by commas for a redundant setup.

Check out the available button presets to find out what you can do with this module.

## AbleSet

This module allows you to control AbleSet from Companion.

If you run Companion on the same machine as AbleSet, you don't have to configure anything.

If AbleSet is running on a different machine, set the `Server Host/IP` field to the IP address of the AbleSet machine and the `Client Host/IP` field to the IP address of the machine running Companion.

Check out the available button presets to find out what you can do with this module.
